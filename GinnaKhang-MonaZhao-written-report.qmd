## Introduction and Data

In our exploration, we're looking into a bunch of spooky places all over the U.S. because October was here, and Halloween was on the 31st. Halloween is known for the idea that the dead might come back to visit. People get into the spirit by dressing up and going to scary events and mysterious places to celebrate. We are curious as to why these places from our dataset are considered haunted -- is it because of specific events or just mysterious stuff?

Our chosen dataset lists 10,992 haunted places in the U.S. It features 10 distinct variables -- including city, county, description, precise location, state, state abbreviation, longitude, latitude, city longitude, and city latitude. The dataset was put together by Tim Renner using [The Shadowlands Haunted Places Index](https://theshadowlands.net/places/), which is a website that contains a list of haunted spots by country and state that people can add to.

Our project explores all these haunted places and helps us look at things like where these places are and what makes them spooky.

-   unexplained phenomena

-   burial grounds and cemeteries

-   legends and folklore

-   psychical or paranormal research

-   cultural and religious beliefs

Figure 1 presents a U.S. map plot that uses color gradients to depict states with the highest haunted place count in light blue gradually transitioning to states with fewer haunted places in dark blue. California is the lightest blue, making it the leading state with the highest number of haunted places, followed by Texas and Philadelphia.

Figure 2 displays a bar graph illustrating the quanity of haunted places for each event type -- paranormal, tragic, unexplainable. In our dataset containing 10,992 haunted places the predominant source is unexplainable events comprising 4,092 occurences. Tragic events comes next, followed by paranormal events.

Figure 3 exhibits a line graph depicting the count of haunted places by event type for each state. As we can see, California holds the highest count for all three event types, with Texas and Philadelphia following. However, Texas surpasses in haunted places for tragic and unexplainable events, wehreas Philadelphia takes the lead in paranormal events compared to Texas.
