## Introduction and Data

In our exploration, we're looking into a bunch of spooky places all over the U.S. because October was here, and Halloween was on the 31st. Halloween is known for the idea that the dead might come back to visit. People get into the spirit by dressing up and going to scary events and mysterious places to celebrate. We are curious as to why these places from our dataset are considered haunted -- is it because of specific events or just mysterious stuff?

Our chosen dataset lists 10,992 haunted places in the U.S. It features 10 distinct variables -- including city, county, description, precise location, state, state abbreviation, longitude, latitude, city longitude, and city latitude. The dataset was put together by Tim Renner using [The Shadowlands Haunted Places Index](https://theshadowlands.net/places/), which is a website that contains a list of haunted spots by country and state that people can add to.

Our project explores all these haunted places and helps us look at things like where these places are and what makes them spooky.

#### Data Explanation

Below are three visuals that contribute to addressing our research question: What are the main factors that contribute to the distribution of haunted locations throughout the United States?" How many locations are there of each category in the following list:

-   tragic or historical events

-   unexplained phenomena

-   burial grounds and cemeteries

-   legends and folklore

-   psychical or paranormal research

-   cultural and religious beliefs

## Methodology

Our main goal is to look at a list of spooky places in the U.S. and figure out why they're considered haunted. Therefore, the most important variable from our dataset is the "description." We relied on this variable to answer our research questions.

Because description contains sentences that explaining why the location is considered haunted, we created a search algorithm to identify specific keywords within these sentences. These keywords will help filter and sort out our data. For instance, if a sentence in the description contained words like

-   commited suicide, death, died, drowned, killed, murdered

we classified the location under the category of tragic events. If it contained words like

-   haunted, ghost, apparition, ghostly, supernatural, paranormal, spirit

then, we classified the location under the category of paranormal events. Anything else would be classified as unexplainable. One thing to note is that there can be an overlap between tragic and paranormal events, as a death or murder at a haunted location may also result in paranormal phenomena.

## Results

In our exploration of 10,992 haunted places in the United States, the analysis of our dataset and the visual representations revealed the main factors contributing to the distribution of haunted locations. The U.S. map (Figure 1) highlighted California as the state with the highest number of haunted places followed by Texas and Philadelphia. This distribution could be attributed to a variety of historical, cultural, and geographical factors unique to each state. The bar graph (Figure 2) showcased that the predominant source of haunting across these locations is unexplainable events, with 4,092 occurrences, indicating a prevalent belief in mysterious and supernatural occurrences. Tragic events come next, followed by paranormal events, emphasizing the diversity in the reasons why places are considered haunted.

The line graph (Figure 3) provided a state-specific breakdown of haunted places by event type, reaffirming California's dominance in all three categories. Texas and Philadelphia emerged as significant players, with Texas leading in haunted places associated with tragic and unexplainable events, while Philadelphia took the lead in paranormal events. If we take look at the state-wise statistics shown in Figure 4, we are able to see what makes up majority of the states haunted locations. For instance, in California, the majority of haunted places are attributed to unexplainable events (423 occurrences), followed by paranormal events (350 occurrences) and tragic events (297 occurrences).

The response to our research inquiry, "What are the primary factors influencing the distribution of haunted locations across the United States?" is evident in Figures 2 and 4. Figure 3 consolidates the occurrence of each event type per state, underscoring that unexplainable events stand out as the primary factor contributing to the haunting of most locations.
